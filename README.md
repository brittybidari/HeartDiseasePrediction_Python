# HeartDiseasePrediction_Python
The repository is a part of a project for Heart Disease Prediction using the concept of Python.
The project aims to perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset for analyzing the best accuracy and model usage using machine learning algorithms.
Furthermore, the project then utilizes the best accurate model to predict heart disease based on user input with interactive UI/UX experience.

# Data Source For The Project
The project utilizes the Kaggle data source https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset as its major Data resource.

# Libraries Used Throughout the Project to conduct the procedure
Numpy
Pandas
MatplotLib and Seaborn
Yellow Brick
Pickle
StatsModel
Xgboost

# Project Pipeline
In this Project SDLC Pipeline is followed to conduct the prediction
1. Initial Data Exploration üîç
2. Exploratory Data Analysis üìâ
3. Dataset Pre-processing ‚öô
4. Model Implementation üõ†
5. Model Comparison
6. Model Selection
7. Dashboard Integration for Model (UI/UX)
8. Testing and Evaluation

# Machine Learning Model
Different model are utilized in the complete procedure to finalize the best prediction model, based on the data set proceedings with supervised learning model presented the best result and observation
1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Gaussian Naive Bayes
5. Decision Tree
6. Random Forest
7. Gradient Boosting
